# Project-specific instructions

> Project-owned overlay. The boilerplate delivers this file once and never overwrites it; every other file in this folder is synced from upstream. Write this project's own rules here, one heading per topic, instead of editing `AGENTS.md` or a synced section. Knowledge about the system under test belongs in a project context skill (`<aspect>-context`), not here.

Add `triggers:` regex sources to the frontmatter above when a rule here should be routed by keyword (the hook reads them), and keep every `NEVER` / `MUST` line reachable: cite `Rule #N`, binding: `/<skill>`, or enforced: `bun run <script>` (checked by `bun run instructions:check`).
